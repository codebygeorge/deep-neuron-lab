# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Frontend Developer Candidate Exercise

---

### **Vue.js Todo Application**

**Objective:**
Develop a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Todo application using Vue.js. This exercise is aimed at evaluating your skills in frontend development, particularly in API integration, application feature implementation using Vue.js and testing. Feel free to be creative and implement something you think it is missing from every similar app.

**API Integration:**
Your application should use the Todo API provided by DummyJSON (https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos) as its backend.

**Key Features requirements:**

1. **List Todos**: Display todos fetched from the DummyJSON API.
2. **Create Todo**: Allow users to add new todos via the application interface.
3. **Update Todo**: Enable editing of existing todos.
4. **Delete Todo**: Implement a feature to delete todos.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API interactions.
6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly and responsive interface.
7. **State**: Implement a mechanism so that the user can preserve the state when reloading
8. (Bonus points) - **Filtering/Searching**: Filter by todo state or/and search by text

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Vue.js**: The application must be built using Vue.js.
- **Libraries and Tools**: You are free to use any additional libraries or tools you find suitable.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-commented, and adhere to best practices.
- **Responsiveness**: The application should be fully responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Documentation**: Include a README with setup and run instructions.

**Testing and Coverage:**

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your application.
- **Test Coverage**: Achieve at least 20% unit test coverage for your code.

**Delivery:**

- Submit your application as a Git repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- Include a clear commit history to show the development and testing process.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Functionality**: All requirements should be met.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be well-structured and readable.
- **User Interface**: The UI should be clean, intuitive, and responsive.
- **Problem-Solving**: Your approach to challenges and feature implementation will be evaluated.
- **Testing**: Quality and coverage of unit tests.

**Time Frame:**

Complete and submit your application within one week from the assignment date.
